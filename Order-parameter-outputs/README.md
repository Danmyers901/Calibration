# Order-parameter-outputs

This code has been adjusted to create and OrdSet AMALGAM output, which is an ordered set of parameter values and their
objective values for each model run. This can be used to analyze the change in parameter values over time as the 
algorithm converges. These four files were changed and the locations of the changes are commented.
