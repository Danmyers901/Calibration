# Multivariable-calibration

The CompOF.m and mcalib.m files are currently set to do 4 objectives: 1) streamflow NSE, 2) standard deviation
of streamflow NSE, 3) SWE mean absolute error, and 4) standard deviation of SWE mean absolute error. Replace
the ones in the Mfiles folder to do the multivariable calibration.
