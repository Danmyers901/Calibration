# Sensitivity-analysis

Here are codes to:

1) generate SWAT model runs without converging, by replacing the AMALGAM.m file, and 

2) perform a PAWN sensitivity analysis for the Great Lakes SWAT model outputs. Place
the SWAT_samples_GLB_SAs_2020_09_08.mat and workflow_pawn_SWAT_GreatLakes.m files in
the original folder of PAWN/SAFE codes (downloaded from https://www.safetoolbox.info/pawn-method/)
and run the workflow.
